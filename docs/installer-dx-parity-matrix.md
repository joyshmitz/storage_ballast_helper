# Installer DX Parity Matrix (dcg -> sbh/fsfs)

This document is the implementation contract for bead `bd-2j5.1`.

Goal: map each dcg installer/update capability to explicit `sbh`/`fsfs` behavior, including scope, status, security posture, and test/logging gates.

## Status Legend

- `implemented`: shipped and covered by tests
- `planned`: scoped and linked to an open bead
- `deferred`: intentionally postponed with rationale
- `n/a`: not applicable to sbh/fsfs

## Explicit CLI/Flag Contract

All flags below are contract-level and must be kept stable unless the parity matrix is updated and linked beads are revised.

### Install (`sbh install` and installer scripts)

| Flag | Meaning | Expected Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--version <semver\|tag>` | Pin specific release | Installs exact requested version or fails with explicit reason |
| `--dest <path>` | Override install destination | Uses destination with same verification and rollback guarantees |
| `--easy` | Opinionated defaults mode | Enables safe defaults + non-interactive prompts where possible |
| `--verify` / `--no-verify` | Integrity policy | `--verify` default; `--no-verify` allowed only with warning + logged reason code |
| `--from-source` | Compile fallback | Builds from source when artifacts unavailable/unsupported |
| `--offline <bundle>` | Airgapped source | Uses local bundle metadata and artifacts only |
| `--quiet` | Minimal output | Suppresses non-error human logs |
| `--no-color` | Disable ANSI output | Forces plain-text output |
| `--no-configure` | Skip integrations | Installs binary only, no shell/tool bootstrap |
| `--json` | Machine output mode | Emits structured events/payloads for automation |

### Update (`sbh update`)

| Flag | Meaning | Expected Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--check` | Check for update only | No mutation; report available versions |
| `--refresh-cache` | Force metadata refresh | Bypasses cached index data |
| `--force` | Apply despite soft guards | Still obeys hard safety constraints and logs override reason |
| `--rollback [backup-id]` | Roll back to prior backup snapshot | Restores selected backup with verification |
| `--list-backups` | Show available backup snapshots | Deterministic newest-first backup inventory |
| `--version <version>` | Target a specific release version | Uses pinned target for check/apply (supports `v` prefix) |
| `--system` / `--user` | Scope selection | Chooses install root and privilege model |
| `--json` | Machine output mode | Phase-level structured output with trace ID |

### Bootstrap (install-time integration phase via `sbh install` / `sbh setup`)

| Flag | Meaning | Expected Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--auto` | Non-interactive bootstrap | Applies safe defaults for unattended workflows |
| `--integrations <list>` | Restrict integration targets | Applies only selected tool integrations |
| `--no-integrations` | Skip all integrations | Bootstrap without config mutation |
| `--backup-dir <path>` | Backup location override | Stores reversible snapshots before mutation |
| `--json` | Machine output mode | Emits migration + bootstrap event records |

### Uninstall (`sbh uninstall`)

| Flag | Meaning | Expected Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Preview actions | No mutation; prints/returns deterministic uninstall plan |
| `--purge` | Remove data/logs/cache | Performs full teardown after explicit confirmation |
| `--keep-config` | Preserve configs | Removes binaries/services while retaining user config |
| `--rollback` | Restore previous install state | Reinstalls from latest valid backup snapshot |
| `--json` | Machine output mode | Structured uninstall events and reason codes |

## Offline Bundle Contract (bd-2j5.20)

The offline bundle contract is intentionally strict so airgapped installs stay deterministic and safe:

1. Bundle lookups prefer nested layout `<bundle>/<asset-name>/<asset-version>/<filename>` and then fall back to flat layout `<bundle>/<filename>`.
2. Bundle path components must be relative and normal-path only; parent traversal (`..`), root/prefix paths, and other non-normal components are rejected.
3. Restored assets must pass SHA-256 verification before being copied into cache/install paths.
4. If bundle lookup or verification fails, offline mode must fail fast with actionable diagnostics (no silent network fallback in explicit offline mode).

## Security Policy Contract

| Policy Area | Default | Allowed Override | Required Logging |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Artifact integrity verification | enabled | `--no-verify` | reason code + operator-visible warning |
| Signature verification (sigstore) | opportunistic/required per policy bead | explicit opt-out when policy allows | verification result, digest, signature status |
| Network trust | release source allowlist | explicit alternate source flag | source URL, trust policy decision |
| Update rollback safety | backup-first mandatory | none | backup ID, retention decision, rollback viability |
| Destructive uninstall behaviors | off by default | `--purge` only | preflight summary + final mutation report |

## Operator Runbook (Install/Update/Rollback)

This runbook is the default operational sequence for humans and agents.

### 1. Preflight

1. Validate config and environment before mutation:
   - `sbh config validate`
   - `sbh status --json`
2. Confirm intended scope:
   - user install/update path: `--user`
   - system install/update path: `--system`
3. Prefer machine-readable execution in automation:
   - add `--json` to install/update/setup/uninstall operations

### 2. Update Decision Path

1. Check first (non-mutating):
   - `sbh update --check --json`
2. Apply only when check output is acceptable:
   - `sbh update --json`
3. For pinned rollouts:
   - `sbh update --version <version> --json`

### 3. Recovery Path

1. On failed update, inspect rollback inventory:
   - `sbh update --list-backups --json`
2. Roll back to latest known-good state:
   - `sbh update --rollback --json`
3. Roll back to a specific restore point when required:
   - `sbh update --rollback <version-or-backup-id> --json`
4. Apply retention policy after incident stabilization:
   - `sbh update --prune <N> --json`

### 4. Post-Change Verification

1. Verify binary and service health:
   - `sbh version --verbose`
   - `sbh status --json`
2. Confirm observability records exist for the operation:
   - trace-level install/update events (per `bd-2j5.18`)
   - phase-level success/failure markers
   - explicit reason codes for policy overrides or bypasses

## Failure Playbooks

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Immediate Action | Required Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Update check is slow or flaky | metadata cache expired, network/API instability | re-run with refresh path and capture JSON output | request metadata source, cache state, trace id |
| Update apply failed after download | checksum/signature/policy rejection | do not force install; inspect verification outcome and reason codes | checksum status, signature status, decision reason |
| New binary fails after apply | incompatible artifact or partial install | execute rollback path immediately | rollback target, backup id, restore result |
| Rollback unavailable | backup creation or retention gap | stop further mutation; collect backup inventory and retention settings | backup inventory, max-retention policy, failure event |
| Service healthy but behavior regressed | config drift or integration mutation | run bootstrap/integration diff checks and restore from backup-first artifacts | changed files list, backup path, remediation action |

## Security Model (Operator View)

### Trust Boundaries

- Release artifacts are trusted only after integrity checks pass.
- Checksums are mandatory by default.
- Signature verification policy is explicit and logged.
- `--no-verify` is an emergency/debug bypass path, never a default.

### Safety Invariants

1. Backup-first mutation for update/rollback-capable paths.
2. Deterministic artifact resolution by host/target contract.
3. Structured decision logging for every allow/deny/bypass decision.
4. No silent downgrade of integrity policy.

### Incident Expectations

- Any bypass or integrity failure must leave a machine-readable trail with stable reason codes.
- Rollback actions must be traceable to a concrete backup/version identifier.
- Operator-facing output and JSON output must describe the same decision outcome.

## Linked Gaps and Dependency Assertions

- This matrix maps every identified parity gap to at least one child bead in epic `bd-2j5`.
- Primary dependency chain unlocked by `bd-2j5.1`:
  - `bd-2j5.1` -> `bd-2j5.3` (artifact resolution contract)
  - `bd-2j5.1` -> `bd-2j5.2` (Unix installer implementation)
  - `bd-2j5.1` -> `bd-2j5.16` (Windows installer parity)
- Cross-cutting quality gates are fixed:
  - unit correctness: `bd-2j5.19`
  - end-to-end behavior: `bd-2j5.14`
  - observability contract: `bd-2j5.18`

## Divergences from dcg (Intentional)

| Area | dcg Behavior | sbh/fsfs Divergence | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Asset bootstrap | limited | includes model/asset bootstrap and offline bundles | sbh runtime may require additional artifacts |
| Migration scope | narrower | explicit self-healing of partial installs/integrations | multi-agent environments drift frequently |
| First-run mode | installer-centric | explicit wizard + `--auto` dual path | support both human and agent operators |

## Exit Criteria for `bd-2j5.1`

- Matrix maintained in-repo (this file) and referenced by downstream beads.
- CLI/flag/security/test contracts are explicit and implementation-ready.
- No parity capability remains unclassified (`implemented/planned/deferred/n/a`).
- Every planned capability maps to concrete bead(s) and validation gates.
