## [v0.4.6] -- 2026-05-02

Tag: [`v0.4.6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/releases/tag/v0.4.6) | Compare: [`v0.4.5...v0.4.6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/compare/v0.4.5...v0.4.6)

Fresh-eyes review of the v0.4.5 incident-fix commit caught two bugs:

### Daemon

- **Fix wrong remediation command in `[SBH-CONFIG-WARNING]` text**. The v0.4.5 message instructed operators to "Run `sbh service install`" — but no such subcommand exists. The actual command is `sudo sbh install --systemd --auto`. Anyone hitting the warning would have been sent on a wild goose chase. Updated to reference the real subcommand for both system- and user-scope installs.

### Tests

- **`deletion_report_tracks_not_writable_paths` skips when running as root**. POSIX `access(W_OK)` always succeeds for root regardless of mode bits, so `chmod 555` doesn't actually deny write — the assertion `report.items_skipped == 1` would fail. CI runs as non-root so the test still exercises the path; on root-owned shells it skips cleanly.

## [v0.4.5] -- 2026-04-30

Tag: [`v0.4.5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/releases/tag/v0.4.5) | Compare: [`v0.4.4...v0.4.5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/compare/v0.4.4...v0.4.5)

Three independent bugs combined to let `ts1` (a 1.9 TB build host) silently hit 100% disk on 2026-04-30. SBH's daemon was running, scanning, and finding candidates — but every delete was failing with `NotWritable`, the scanner was timing out before enumerating the giant directories, the dampener refused to retry recently-deleted paths even as pressure climbed, and pressure tracking missed the root mount entirely. This release fixes all four root causes, surfaces the misconfiguration as an actionable warning, and ships safer defaults.

### Daemon

- **Surface `NotWritable` skips as a single actionable `[SBH-CONFIG-WARNING]`** instead of one log line per candidate. When the systemd unit's `ProtectSystem=strict` + `ReadWritePaths=` whitelist excludes a scanner root, every delete fails silently. The warning is rate-limited to once per hour per executor and includes concrete remediation (re-run `sudo sbh install --systemd --auto` or strip `ProtectSystem=strict`). Adds `not_writable_paths` to `DeletionReport`.
- **Repeat-deletion dampener now also bypasses on imminent danger** (urgency ≥ 0.85), not just at Red pressure. On TBs of disk under high build throughput, free space can drop from Yellow (14% free) to Critical (~0%) in a single poll interval, skipping Red entirely. The predictive controller's high-urgency signal now triggers the bypass — the dampener no longer sits idle while disk fills.
- **`check_pressure()` always includes `/` alongside configured `scanner.root_paths`**. When a user configured `root_paths = ["/tmp", "/data/tmp", "/data/projects"]`, the daemon stopped monitoring `/` directly. If those subdirs don't drive pressure (e.g. `/tmp` is tmpfs), the root mount could fill silently. Per-mount dedup makes this free when `/` is already implied.

### Scanner

- **Default `scan_time_budget_secs` raised from 300 → 900**. On agent-swarm hosts, `/data/tmp` can hold 10K–48K stale test artifacts (frankenlibc/fr_live_oracle fixtures, beads_mem temp DBs, etc). 300s let the scanner enumerate ~3% of such directories before aborting, so the actual disk hogs were never identified as candidates.

### Installer / Service

- **`default_read_write_paths` now probes for `/data` and `/data/tmp`** (only adds them if the directory exists, so unit doesn't break on hosts without `/data`). Universal on the agent-fleet machines this tool was built for.
- Auto-detect release asset format (raw binary vs tar.xz) so the installer works regardless of how the release was packaged ([`9a5782a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/9a5782adeb50cbe268863e6076e92dd753f6db07))

### Tests

- Two new dampener tests: `repeat_dampening_high_urgency_bypasses_at_yellow` (regression) and `repeat_dampening_low_urgency_at_yellow_still_dampens` (sanity).
- New `deletion_report_tracks_not_writable_paths` test verifies the new bucket on Unix hosts (uses `chmod 555` on a tempdir parent).

## [v0.3.16] -- 2026-03-15

Tag: [`v0.3.16`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/releases/tag/v0.3.16) | Compare: [`v0.3.15...v0.3.16`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/compare/v0.3.15...v0.3.16)

This tag has no corresponding GitHub Release. It decouples the CI release pipeline from the quality gate so releases are no longer blocked by unrelated gate failures.

### CI / Build

- Decouple release builds from quality gate ([`44f26a4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/44f26a40792268ad6e40148bd5d36a90fc7968c9))
- Bump version to 0.3.16 for release ([`0d85778`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/0d8577845bb2bb69ee2de8c23d3343123b6b544d))

## [v0.3.15] -- 2026-03-12

Tag: [`v0.3.15`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/releases/tag/v0.3.15) | Compare: [`v0.2.8...v0.3.15`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/compare/v0.2.8...v0.3.15)

This tag has no corresponding GitHub Release. It covers all development from v0.2.8 through v0.3.15 -- a rapid series of production-tuning point releases (v0.3.0 through v0.3.15) that were not individually published. Version numbers v0.3.6 and v0.3.9 were skipped. The intermediate version bumps are noted in subsection headers below.

### Prediction Engine (v0.3.0)

- **Burst detection in EWMA rate estimator**: two-factor burst detection (rate acceleration + magnitude) prevents the predictor from extrapolating transient spikes into false exhaustion forecasts ([`6516579`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/6516579b58ce5496e72a1aea0b390840b56c0b06), [`e00c4e3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/e00c4e3ee36cd757c148a316d8dff1399b97425e))
- **Prediction scorecard**: tracks prediction accuracy over time, solving the self-defeating prophecy problem where successful interventions make the predictor look wrong ([`c0dcc23`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/c0dcc239a14e36a6d82f3b20be81fb96037303c1))
- **Burst-aware prediction gating**: predictions during detected bursts are suppressed or confidence-degraded ([`392a250`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/392a250ce0c4b9e2c08b96b45bc4fbf276719b8d))
- Move `burst_min_confidence` to `PredictionConfig` for cleaner configuration hierarchy ([`061e33d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/061e33dba15ca2203a284c153d97160a29a6c82e))
- Make `CalibrationBreach` advisory-only, lower escalation threshold to Yellow ([`7f121e5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/7f121e50493d5d86342338ef3ee1d4a1a3b76ec9))
- Exclude TUI feature from CI/release builds and enable `workflow_call` ([`61efc64`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/61efc6425268ef5ec66aae9099266403eddb885e))

### Burst Detection + Guard (v0.3.4)

- **MAD-based burst detection**: uses Median Absolute Deviation instead of standard deviation for robust outlier identification ([`ded16b5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/ded16b561b86abd8aefb7b157add63d1a488ecb4))
- Burst-aware guard with median-rate cross-check to prevent false guard triggers during legitimate activity spikes

### Decision-Theoretic Guard (v0.3.5)

- **Multi-level PressureLevel enum**: replaces boolean `pressure_is_green` with Green/Yellow/Orange/Red/Critical levels for fine-grained policy scaling ([`7e5dfe2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/7e5dfe2a2f8dd27fdbc23b63035f622c28be5eca))

### Yellow Pressure Fixes (v0.3.7 / v0.3.8)

- Fix Yellow-pressure rejection deadlock and suppress Green false alarms ([`d969599`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/d96959981dbcf15edad91fcb8bf9f3dc2246aeb4))
- Extend prediction and guard-trigger suppression to Yellow pressure ([`dce72c6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/dce72c625e812bb5ecf64209dae6cf1b0ec7d304))
- Reduce guard penalty deadlock at Yellow pressure and suppress false alarm notifications ([`a00c77b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/a00c77ba66138c6e73c7e0d339bdba8d5a79e86b))
- Tune guard penalty scaling, suppress Green-pressure predictions, reduce log noise ([`97df2d0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/97df2d020aaa366458f271afaa95f76bfad1c125))

### Calibration + Diagnostics (v0.3.10 -- v0.3.12)

- **Directional calibration guard**: only triggers on predictions in the dangerous direction, ignoring benign miscalibrations ([`0e150dd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/0e150ddc5770715ae2989722941f4bcbe0b6a0f2))
- Widen idle noise threshold and bound `rate_danger_ratio` denominator to prevent division-by-near-zero ([`17bc885`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/17bc88598f0606fa0aa61e18541b6c550bc450bc))
- Double `min_observations` to 60 and fix scanner candidate count reporting ([`a188332`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/a1883327a823467b512503780698c5822f8d841b))
- Reduce log noise and improve e-process penalty scaling ([`181518d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/181518da26887575f5631be271977d134d8d19c8))

## [v0.2.8] -- 2026-03-01 **[release]**

Tag: [`v0.2.8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/releases/tag/v0.2.8) | Compare: [`v0.2.1...v0.2.8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.8)

Critical production fix release. The daemon was becoming non-functional on most deployed machines due to a cascade of safety mechanisms triggering during green pressure (plenty of free disk space), which paradoxically blocked cleanup when pressure eventually rose.

Version numbers v0.2.2 through v0.2.7 were skipped; development proceeded directly from v0.2.1 to v0.2.8.

### Policy Engine

- **Green-pressure suppression**: guard-triggered FallbackSafe entries suppressed when disk pressure is green -- miscalibrated predictions are harmless when no deletions would occur ([`474f700`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/474f7009694c7c33dc25b47bed9a820c74174e4b))
- **FallbackSafe deadlock broken**: emergency escalation to Enforce mode with grace period when FallbackSafe has persisted too long under sustained pressure ([`8ddddb0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/8ddddb07651a40f70b930cbe3c54a85afebeaecf), [`103957e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/103957eb843c3ad61caa2c8f40103880f53446a3), [`006ef34`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/006ef342f947b35bb6baacc7c94ff750a9ff1727))
- **Anti-thrash cooldown**: rapid mode oscillation (canary/FallbackSafe) dampened with minimum dwell times ([`82f9d9d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/82f9d9d122ec4a00d8b4b4bf566d4949cc946a2d))
- Canary budget exhaustion pauses deletions until next hour instead of locking down the entire engine ([`82f9d9d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/82f9d9d122ec4a00d8b4b4bf566d4949cc946a2d))

### Scanner + Patterns

- Recognize `rch_target_*`, `rch-target-*`, and `target_codex*` build artifact directories from remote compilation and Codex agents ([`bf03a78`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/bf03a782c1ca681ce8cf775989366e5685a5f2f1))
- Add `/data/tmp` and `/var/tmp` to default scan root paths ([`1f706dd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/1f706dd324809a6baca54a7ebe28ffcf2ae41aeb))
- Configurable `scan_time_budget_secs` (default doubled from 60s to 120s) ([`1f706dd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/1f706dd324809a6baca54a7ebe28ffcf2ae41aeb))

### Daemon

- **Zram false-positive fix**: high zram usage with plenty of free RAM is normal compressed-memory behavior, not disk thrashing ([`9b81294`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/9b81294b8213f772574eca7fc2ca45a7c5f0e66f))
- Correct swap thrash detection inversion and add prediction jitter confidence tracking ([`7999715`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/7999715a91de716a612b529232af539470615cb2))
- Cap predictive warning severity by confidence level -- 1% confidence no longer triggers CRIT ([`3130ce1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/3130ce1cf3d843210a400baf4626ecd20f38ae86))
- Rate-limit scanner saturation messages to once per 60 seconds ([`9b81294`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/9b81294b8213f772574eca7fc2ca45a7c5f0e66f))

### CLI

- **`sbh log` subcommand**: read and tail the JSONL event log with `--follow` and `--type` filtering ([`9e46a58`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/9e46a586aadf5cca5c2d15e19e0fd0870c9ce616))
- Cross-user daemon detection via systemd/process scan when config paths differ between root daemon and non-root CLI user ([`9e46a58`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/9e46a586aadf5cca5c2d15e19e0fd0870c9ce616))

### Platform + Service Management

- Gate `--systemd`/`--launchd` by platform before ballast provisioning ([`c49ec5d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/c49ec5d81dbca1708ece01ca4f55c534cf4a3f72))
- Require root for system-scope systemd with clear guidance ([`14e4596`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/14e45966217579706c6f01f491c92a434c7fe2b2))
- Auto-detect non-root on macOS and use user-scope launchd ([`3615ed5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/3615ed5444e435fef2f7b111ef165ed70e17e6e5))
- Use `root:wheel` for chown recommendation on macOS ([`9d37d47`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/9d37d47ac5b0e081cf83acd540c03ce9a6d2b076))

### TUI

- TUI gated behind optional feature flag + walker cancellation token ([`97ea033`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/97ea03311dfd57446039a77875770bea08ece7ff))
- Signal interception for TUI terminal session ([`39ea6a0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/39ea6a046e3345ac511cf3d17bae3840f113c66b))
- Explicit lifetime annotations on TUI styled rendering functions ([`134833c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/134833c2422f217e09e51519941e728da06e588d))
- Switch ftui dependency from local paths to crates.io v0.2.1 ([`f41259c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/f41259c86d5c012cb1efc38d9123baab6b6c04f2))

### Licensing

- Parse meminfo unit suffix instead of assuming kB ([`085238b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/085238b68ee469a8f299e4b711b6e88856baac77))
- Decode all octal escape sequences in mount paths ([`0156847`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/01568478042c67c655d51e01fb37e11e59c256e6))
- Windows PowerShell installer ([`3bcd099`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/3bcd099c26d15956206b12ffd032f7fb933d6b48))

### Build + Safety Constraints

- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in both `lib.rs` and `main.rs`
- No async runtime -- OS threads with `crossbeam-channel` and `parking_lot`
- Pedantic + nursery Clippy lints enabled project-wide
- Deterministic builds: `opt-level = "z"`, LTO, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, stripped
- Linux x86_64 and macOS arm64 release artifacts

### Tests

- Decision-plane proof harness with 26 tests ([`a3eaade`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/a3eaadee8d494c3b257ef8562bb1f3b0d582ca05))

- Comprehensive E2E test suite ([`85f96ea`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/85f96eaa0a4a997346821ba860acfc956e4a8c6a))
- Deep code audit fixes across scoring, deletion, PID, EWMA, PAL, bootstrap, guardrails ([`822e5ce`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/822e5ce4d01f8e21e44d2e3e5b7d86ebdeefbd0a), [`aeb873c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/storage_ballast_helper/commit/aeb873c5316329e80bfb7114f31abc62f9509957))

### Repository Initialization
